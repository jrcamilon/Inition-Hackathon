//	between each LED lighting. After the LED has reached the last light
//	of the cycle, the system sleeps again for 1 second.
//	The sleeps are cumulative, so the system has slept for 1.5 seconds
//	sum total for each cycle.
//	setInterval and setTimeout make asynchronous function calls;
//	they aren't cumulative.
//	In order to approximate the behavior of the C++ example, we need
//	to call each iteration 1.5 seconds apart instead of 1 second apart.
